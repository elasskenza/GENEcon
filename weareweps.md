# Knowledge

At **Women in Economics Paris & Saclay (WEPS)**, one of our key goals is to gather and disseminate information on **gender imbalances** in economics. We recognize the importance of learning about these issues in order to effectively address and mitigate gender disparities.

To achieve this goal, we have curated a diverse collection of sources and topics related to gender imbalances. Our resources cover a wide range of areas, including but not limited to, academia, policymaking, labor markets, and social norms. 
> Find [here in our newsletters](https://weps-womeninecon.github.io/Webpage/newsletters/) a variety of sources and topics to learn about gender imbalances.

# Exchange

Through our initiatives, we hope to **facilitate an open and constructive dialogue** around gender imbalances in economics, promote greater awareness of these issues, and ultimately drive positive change. 
> Join us in our efforts to create a more equitable and inclusive economics field for all.
