The **GENEcon Network** is an initiative to gather scholars working in **gender economics**, politics and demography, with a mission to improve **womenâ€™s outcomes** and **reduce inequalities**. We bring together scholars carrying out research on the causes and consequences of **gender inequality in education, labour markets and the family**.
{: .notice--accent}

Our network brings together researchers from [WISPPRH at the London School of Economics](https://www.lse.ac.uk/social-policy/research/Research-clusters/WISPPRH), from the [AXA Gender Lab at Bocconi University](https://genderlab.unibocconi.eu/), and from [NYU Abu Dhabi](https://nyuad.nyu.edu/en/).
