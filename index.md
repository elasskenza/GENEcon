The **GENEcon Network** is an initiative to gather scholars working in **gender economics**, politics and demography, with a mission to improve **women’s outcomes** and **reduce inequalities**. We bring together scholars carrying out research on the causes and consequences of **gender inequality in education, labour markets and the family**.
