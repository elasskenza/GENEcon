    <h1>Welcome to the GENEcon Network</h1>

> The <strong>GENEcon Network</strong> is a collaborative initiative aimed at bringing together scholars who are committed to advancing the field of <strong>gender economics</strong>. Our mission is to foster research that improves <strong>women’s outcomes</strong> and works toward the <strong>reduction of inequalities</strong> in society.
> We unite researchers investigating the origins and impacts of <strong>gender inequality</strong> in key areas such as <strong>education, labor markets, and family dynamics</strong>.

> Our evidence-based research takes on a broad perspective on women’s outcomes and focuses on how gender influences individuals’ opportunities across different life course stages and their well-being. We pay specific attention to local contexts and social and public policy environments while addressing these issues around the World. 

> We collaborate with policymakers in governments, international organisations, the third sector and private companies. We believe that through such collaborations, we can help create a world where both men and women can maximise their potential and welfare equally.
