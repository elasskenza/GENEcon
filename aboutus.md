> The Women in Social and Public Policy Research Hub (WISPPRH) at the Department of Social Policy, LSE,  informs social and public policies that improve women’s outcomes and reduce inequalities. We bring together scholars carrying out research on the causes and consequences of gender inequality in education, labour markets and the family. 

> Our evidence-based research takes on a broad perspective on women’s outcomes and focuses on how gender influences individuals’ opportunities across different life course stages and their well-being. We pay specific attention to local contexts and social and public policy environments while addressing these issues around the World. 

> We collaborate with policymakers in governments, international organisations, the third sector and private companies. We believe that through such collaborations, we can help create a world where both men and women can maximise their potential and welfare equally.
